# sort

Implement sorting algorithms and compare their runtime
Consider number sorting algorithms as follows:
- insertion - bubble - quick - heap - selection - counting - radix - bucket - tree
These algorithms are on the Internet and in the CLRS book (some of them). Study these algorithms and implement them with ++ C / C and call them with function pointer.
Read the complete CLRS book, chapters 1 to 4. Analyze the cost of running algorithms on paper based on what is said on paper in these 4 chapters.
In the continuation of the project, add the runtime calculation code available on the Internet to the program and test each algorithm in three modes: optimistic, pessimistic, random, and note the time costs and compare them with the analyzes you performed on paper. do.

Optimistic Mode: An array of n elements that are sorted.
Pessimistic mode: An array of n elements that are arranged but in reverse
Random mode: An array of n elements that are completely random.

The value of n is 5 million to start with
You will be given 3 optimistic, pessimistic and random files that contain the desired numbers.
